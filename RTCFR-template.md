# RTCFR Prompt Engineering Technique Notes

## ðŸ“Œ What is RTCFR?
**RTCFR** is a structured framework for writing high-quality, reliable prompts for AI language models. It stands for:

- **R** â†’ Role  
- **T** â†’ Task  
- **C** â†’ Context  
- **F** â†’ Few Shots (Examples)  
- **R** â†’ Report/Tone  

This technique ensures clarity, precision, and consistency in AI-generated responses.

## ðŸ“– Components Explained

### ðŸŸ¢ **R â†’ Role**
**Define the role you want the AI to adopt.**  
Helps tailor the modelâ€™s behavior and perspective.

**Example:**  
- *You are a senior Python developer.*  
- *You are a friendly English grammar tutor for grade 6 students.*


### ðŸŸ¢ **T â†’ Task**
**Clearly state what you want the AI to do.**  
Be direct and action-oriented.

**Example:**  
- *Explain the concept of recursion with a simple example.*  
- *Create a motivational Instagram caption.*


### ðŸŸ¢ **C â†’ Context**
**Provide relevant background information.**  
Helps the AI generate relevant, accurate, and on-topic outputs.

**Example:**  
- *The audience is beginner programmers with no prior experience.*  
- *The target users are small business owners looking to automate support tasks.*


### ðŸŸ¢ **F â†’ Few Shots (Examples)**
**Give a few sample inputs and expected outputs (if needed).**  
Demonstrates the kind of response you expect.  
*Optional but highly useful for complex or stylistic prompts.*

**Example:**  

**Input:** `Convert "I eating now" to correct English.`  
**Output:** `I am eating now.`


### ðŸŸ¢ **R â†’ Report / Tone**
**Specify the tone or style of the response you need.**  
Ensures consistency in personality and delivery.

**Example:**  
- *Use a warm and encouraging tone.*  
- *Keep the explanation concise and professional.*  
- *Sound like a witty, playful social media manager.*
